# Final-jdiscipi-jpage9
Hungry Hungry Square (TM)

## Important Info
Our program works on Windows, collaborators include:

### Collaborators
Jared DiScipio (jdiscipi) - Project Manager

Jack Page (jpage9) - Programming Afficionado 

### Requirements
User must have MinGW along with FreeGLUT installed and properly configured. 

### Statement of Academic Integrity
All code in this project is authored either by the collaborators listed above, or by the Instructor.

## How to play
Run the graphics executable and a window will pop up.

You are the blue square and you are very.... very hungry!
Move the mouse, use the arrow keys, or try growing or shrinking to make life easier or harder.

## UI
The first screen the user sees is the game screen where the game shall be played. It is during this time that the user will see that the blue square can move and consume the orange dots. 

There is a tooltip at the bottom left of the screen which informs the user of the help menu and the keybind to open it.

The help menu displays some of the instructions for the game, but some have been left out such as the growing and shrinking functionality to leave some easter eggs for the player to discover (covered in presentation video).

When the user eats all the dots, they win the game and will be taken to the end screen.

There is an additional keybind to quit the program at any time (the escape key).
